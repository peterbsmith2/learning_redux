# learning_redux
A Repository for learning Redux.js

Current includes code from following along with 

1. [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) by Dan Abramov, creator of Redux
2. [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) by Dan Abramov, creator of Redux
  
Both directories include the code written in the videos, annotated with my notes on the topic(s) covered. Notes are inline. Many of the videos are showing multiple ways to achieve the same effect, with each progressive video showing a better way to do a thing.

For example, the Getting Started series goes through how to create a combineReducers function then shows the redux package's built in combineReducers function.

In the Getting Started directory there is a file `egghead.txt` which has general notes from the series

In the Idiomatic directory each subdirectory has a `changes.js` file which accumulates the changes from lesson to lesson, for a complete overview see the `changes.js` file in the 27th video folder.

Also in the Idiomatic directory type `npm run XX` where `XX` is the number of the lesson, to run the code on `localhost:3000`
